# DNS Tunneling Detection with Adversarial Machine Learning
This project implements an adversarial machine learning pipeline to detect DNS tunneling attacks. It uses Random Forest classifiers trained on both clean and adversarially crafted datasets. The adversarial examples are generated based on feature importance to evaluate the robustness of the model.
Features
Extracts and preprocesses datasets from ZIP archives containing CSV files.
Handles missing values, label encoding for categorical features, and feature scaling.
Selects the top k features based on ANOVA F-statistic.
Trains and evaluates a Random Forest classifier on clean data.
Generates adversarial examples by perturbing features based on their importance.
Combines clean and adversarial examples for adversarial training.
Evaluates model performance on clean and adversarial test sets.
Provides detailed performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## Datasets

#### The project requires two datasets

**Regular Data**: A ZIP file containing benign DNS traffic.

**Tunneling Data**: A ZIP file containing DNS tunneling traffic is Attack.zip.
Ensure the datasets are in CSV format and correctly zipped before running the script.

#### To install all dependencies, run
pip install -r requirements.txt

##  Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dns_tunneling_adversarial_model.git

#### cd dns_tunneling_adversarial_model
Place the ZIP archives for regular and tunneling datasets in the project root directory.

#### Run the Python script
python dns_tunneling_model.py
View the metrics, feature importance, and visualizations generated by the script.

## Output
The script generates the following outputs:

**Top Features**: Lists the most important features selected for training.

**Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for clean and adversarial test sets.

**Confusion Matrices**: Heatmaps showing performance on clean and adversarial data.

**Adversarially Trained Model**: Saved as dns_tunneling_adversarial_model.pkl.
